            Some may have heard it before, but the total population in Japan has been decreasing every year since early
            <br>
            2000s. Its government prefects its population would continue to drop by a little bit every year. However, I
            <br>
            was curious and wanted to communicate the message of population change and trends for certain states. Japan
            <br>
            has 47 states (called prefectures), and does every state decrease its population since total population has
            <br>
            been decreasing? The answer is no. There are 7 states have increased population this past 10 years, which
            <br>
            users would be able to see in “Changes by State”. <br>

            This is

            Each scene is followed by bar graph, and the structure is contestant across this narrative visualization<br>

            in<br>
            the title. There are also tooltips and annotations for users to follow, so they can stay focused on the<br>
            presented data on each scene.<br>

            There are 8 buttons on the top of each html page, and viewers can follow the buttons from the left to

            The annotation template contains texts and pointers to pinpoint the location that I would like to
            emphasize<br>
            in the bar graph. The annotations especially support certain data points. For example, I used one for
            the<br>
            last bar graph to deliver the message where the population has been decreasing and it pointed the
            location<br>
            of the bar graph, so users are easily able to follow and focus the message I would like to communicate.
            Some<br>
            annotations change since the trends are changed and I would like to put emphasis on the increased or<br>
            decreased values.
