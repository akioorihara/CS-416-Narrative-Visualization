        One of the thfree effective Interactive Slideshow <br>
        User can click on various data point in the graph to see more
        details in the next slides. User can go back and forth between the slides to choose a different data point and
        analye the results.
        Messaging. What is the message you are trying to communicate with the narrative visualization?

        Narrative Structure. Which structure was your narrative visualization designed to follow (martini glass,
        interactive slide show or drop-down story)? How does your narrative visualization follow that structure? (All of
        these structures can include the opportunity to "drill-down" and explore. The difference is where that
        opportunity happens in the structure.)

        Visual Structure. What visual structure is used for each scene? How does it ensure the viewer can understand the
        data and navigate the scene? How does it highlight to urge the viewer to focus on the important parts of the
        data in each scene? How does it help the viewer transition to other scenes, to understand how the data connects
        to the data in other scenes?

        Scenes. What are the scenes of your narrative visualization? How are the scenes ordered, and why

        Annotations. What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used
        to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene, and if so, how and why

        Parameters. What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative
        visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?

        Triggers. What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization?
        What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the
        narrative visualization?
